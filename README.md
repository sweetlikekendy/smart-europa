## Editing Content

Once Stackbit creates a site, you can start editing the content using the free on-page editing experience provided by the [Stackbit Studio](https://stackbit.com?utm_source=project-readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=user_themes).

## Develop Locally

1. [Create a site](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/stackbit-themes/starter-gatsby-sanity&utm_source=theme-readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stackbit_themes) from this theme using Stackbit.

1. Stackbit will create a new GitHub repository, a [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io) project, and deploy the site via the selected serverless deployment platform (e.g., [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)).

1. Stackbit will deploy the [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/studio) and [Stanity GraphQL API](https://www.sanity.io/docs/graphql) for you.

1. When finished, clone the generated repository.

1. Install npm dependencies:

        npm install

1. Optionally, run Sanity Studio locally by installing sanity-cli, and then installing and running the studio from the `/studio` directory. You may be required to login with the Sanity CLI.

        npm install -g @sanity/cli
        cd studio
        sanity install
        sanity start

1. Set the following environment variables locally.

   - `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` - Sanity project ID (you can copy it from the `api.projectId` key in [studio/sanity.json](studio/sanity.json))
   - `SANITY_DATASET` - Sanity dataset name (optional, default is `production`)
   - `SANITY_TOKEN` - Sanity read-write token (you can copy it from the "environment" section in your Netlify site https://app.netlify.com/sites/<netlify-site-name>/settings/deploys#environment)

1. Start the Gatsby local development server (run from project root):

        npm run develop
